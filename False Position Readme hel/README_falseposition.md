This code is designed to solve a root using false position with inputs :


func - the function being evaluated
 - the lower guess
 - the upper guess
es - the desired relative error (should default to 0.0001%)
maxit - the maximum number of iterations to use (should default to 200)
varargin, . . . - any additional parameters used by the function
