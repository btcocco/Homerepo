This code is designed to sort and solve for a linear regression line. The inputs an x and y data sets. 

The output are :

Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
Slope from the linear regression (m in )
Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
Rsquared value
